# R5-Reloaded-Installer

This is the installer for R5 Reloaded.

It is an installer that even installs detours_r5 and scripts_r5 on the game client.

Since the game client is in Torrent format, I use Transmission to download it.

The torrent file is generated when you run it.

# About Transmission
Transmisson's original software doesn't officially build cli, so we're using a fork of the wrapper project.
Therefore, there are dependencies.

# How to use

There is a GUI and CUI in the release.

The GUI can be installed like a Windows installer.

CUI runs CLI-based and produces only R5R.

1. Download and unzip the Zip file from the [release](https://github.com/Limitex/R5-Reloaded-Installer/releases).
2. Click R5-Reloaded-Installer.exe to launch it.
3. You will be asked for firewall permission immediately, so please allow it.
4. All you have to do is wait. R5 is stored in the R5-Reloaded directory in the directory.

### Please if possible
Launch another torrent software and select the torrent file in the directory to download and seed.
