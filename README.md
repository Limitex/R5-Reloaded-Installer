# R5-Reloaded-Installer

This is the initial installer for R5 Reloaded.

It is an installer that even installs detours_r5 and scripts_r5 on the game client.

The URL required for installation can be found in info.links.
If the wrong URL or format is incorrect, an error may occur.
Since the game client is in Torrent format, I use aria2 to download it.

Also, the game client is torrent, but this software has stopped seeding. 
So seed using different torrent software as much as possible. 
This is because others may not be able to download it.

#How to use

1. Download and unzip the Zip file from the release.
2. Click R5-Reloaded-Installer.exe to launch it.
3. You will be asked for firewall permission immediately, so please allow it.
4. All you have to do is wait. R5 is stored in the R5-Reloaded directory in the directory.
(5. Launch another torrent software and select the torrent file in the directory to download and seed.)
