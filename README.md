# R5-Reloaded-Installer

This is the initial installer for R5 Reloaded.

It is an installer that even installs detours_r5 and scripts_r5 on the game client.

The URL required for installation can be found in info.links.
If the wrong URL or format is incorrect, an error may occur.
Since the game client is in Torrent format, I use aria2 to download it.

[Click here for aria2 release](https://github.com/aria2/aria2/releases/)

Also, the game client is torrent, but this software has stopped seeding. 
So seed using different torrent software as much as possible. 
This is because others may not be able to download it.

# 1. A runtime is required to run this program.
It runs using .NET Core 3.1, so please install it beforehand.

1. Click Windows [x64] in the [.NET runtime (version)] on the following page to download.
2. Run the downloaded installer to install the runtime.

[.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/3.1)

3. You will be asked for firewall permission immediately, so please allow it.
